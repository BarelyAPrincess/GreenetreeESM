<-- Negociation Process -->

-->	Data Destinations ( DVR -> CES Server )
	D) Open Connection
	D) GET /fwd/xdvr/xDVR HTTP/1.0
	S) HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	S) Content-type: application/octet-stream
	S) \r\n\r\n
	D) SGIA {ESM ID} {PASSWORD}
	S) ?
	

<-- Commands -->

Command		Args		HasId	HasPayload	Notes
ping			0		no		no			Used to keep connection alive
pong			0		no		no			Used to say connection is alive
SGIA			2		yes		yes			Unknown Use
	Arg1: Possibly the ESM ID for each DVR - 47 53 31 30 33 30 54 38 30 30
	Arg2: 12 f6 9b 08 09 ad e3 06 19 25 44 6f c9 a3 71 40 23 2f a4 f8 -> 123???
	Arg2: fa 09 fc 35 51 a7 db b4 c9 93 9a 95 fa 9d 82 c8 3d 24 8f 8d -> Another Password???
Hex: 65		1		yes		yes			Possibly a command response from server
	When I send a bad command I get payload "badCommand" with a keyset
	Failed logins give payload "failed" with no keyset - This is possibly indication each response is apart of the API but of seperate subsystems, different types?
